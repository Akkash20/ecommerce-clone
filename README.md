Flipkart Clone Project using MERN Stack
Welcome to the Flipkart Clone project! This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The project aims to replicate some of the core functionalities of the popular e-commerce platform Flipkart.

Project Structure
The project is organized into two main folders:

client: This folder contains the front-end part of the application built with React.js, Redux, and Material-UI.
server: This folder contains the back-end part of the application built with Node.js and Express.js, connected to a MongoDB database.
Features
User authentication and authorization.
Browse and search products with various filters.
Add products to the cart and proceed to checkout.
Order history and tracking.
Responsive design using Material-UI for a better user experience on different devices.
Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/flipkart-clone.git

Navigate to the project folder: cd flipkart-clone

Install dependencies for both the client and server:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
Set up the environment variables:

For the server, create a .env file in the server folder and define the necessary variables like database connection string, JWT secret, etc.
For the client, create a .env file in the client folder if required (e.g., if you need to specify the server URL).
Start the development server for both the client and server:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm start
bash
Copy code
cd server
npm start
The client should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 and the server at http://localhost:8000.

Deployment
The project has been hosted on Netlify for the client and on a server provider (e.g., Heroku) for the server. To deploy the project:

Set up a production build for the client:

arduino

cd client
npm run build
Deploy the production build on Netlify or any other static hosting service.

Deploy the server on your chosen server provider. Make sure to set up environment variables on the server for production (e.g., database connection string, production port, etc.).

Update the client with the production server URL (if different from the development URL) to make API requests.
